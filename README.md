A hands-on Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates implementing a GPT-style text generation model and exposing it with a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI). The notebook covers dataset preparation, model loading/fine-tuning (or using a pretrained model), generating text, and packaging the generation code so it can be called from a terminal.

Key features

Load and inspect text data.

Use a pretrained Transformer/GPT model (or a minimal training loop) for text generation.

Tokenization and detokenization examples.

Beam/sample/top-k/top-p sampling demonstrations.

A small CLI wrapper to generate text from terminal input.

Examples and sample prompts to reproduce outputs.

Why this notebook

This notebook is ideal for learners who want to:

Understand how GPT-style text generation works end-to-end.

See how to move from notebook experiments to a portable CLI tool.

Experiment with decoding strategies and small fine-tuning runs.
