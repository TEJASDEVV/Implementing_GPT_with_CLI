# 🚀 Implementing GPT with CLI

A hands-on **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates implementing a GPT-style text generation model and exposing it with a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.  

The notebook covers:  
- Dataset preparation  
- Model loading & fine-tuning (or using a pretrained model)  
- Generating text with different sampling strategies  
- Packaging the generation code so it can be called from a terminal

## ✨ Key Features
- 📂 Load and inspect text data  
- 🤖 Use a pretrained Transformer/GPT model (or train a minimal GPT loop)  
- 🔤 Tokenization & detokenization examples  
- 🎲 Sampling strategies: beam search, top-k, top-p, temperature  
- 💻 Simple CLI wrapper for text generation from the terminal  
- 📝 Example prompts & outputs

## 🎯 Why this Notebook?
This notebook is ideal for learners who want to:  
- Understand how GPT-style text generation works **end-to-end**  
- Learn how to move from notebook experiments to a **portable CLI tool**  
- Experiment with **different decoding strategies** and small fine-tuning runs
